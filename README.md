Project v0 Goals
- Be able to access private youtube data through OAuth and Youtube Data API
- Get all my playlists in json form
- Get all my watched videos in json form
- Simplest possible keyword tagging
- Simplest possible querying by keywords
- Simplest possible filtering (watched vs not, which playlist, video upload year, video watched year)
